# Work Sample for StarRepublic

This is a React.js application hosted in a .Net Core 3.0 project.

## Launch instructions

Note: I have only tested this on my Mac (macOS Catalina 10.15.2). I expect that it works on Windows and Linux too, but I cannot guarantee it.

From Visual Studio:

Open the .sln file and set the SpotifyRecommendations project as Startup Project.

From Bash:

Run the launch.sh script.
