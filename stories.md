# User Stories for the application

- Display images of the artists and tracks.
- Navigate back to previous results.

## Refactoring stories

- There are no tests for the frontend.
- The energy, market, and popularity parameters should not be hard-coded.
- I wonder if there's a way to merge the SearchTracks and SearchArtists queries. They use the same endpoint, yet their response structures are not the same.
